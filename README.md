# Predicting Customer Satisfaction

## PROBLEM AT HAND

Customer satisfaction is one of the key aspects of running a successful business model. Feedback based business decisions have seen remarkable growth in-terms of business reach, product sales, and optimization of supply networks. For this reason, we chose to select a dataset provided by Olist Stores, a prominent e-commerce website based in Brazil. Olist connects small businesses all over Brazil to channels with a single contract and no trouble. Those businesses can sell their goods on the Olist Store and have them shipped straight to customers through Olist logistics partners. A seller is notified after a buyer orders a product through Olist Store and is responsible for fulfilling that order. The customer receives an email with a satisfaction survey where they can rate his purchase experience and leave some remarks.
